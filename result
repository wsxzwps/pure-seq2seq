__GO__ sure . first of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__		what ' i ' ? __eou__
__GO__ yeah , that's very important . __eou__		i you you . __eou__
__GO__ so you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ i ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__		do you have any __eou__
__GO__ that ' s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__		i ' i t . __eou__
__GO__ it ' s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__		i ' you t ? __eou__
__GO__ it ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__		i you i to to . __eou__
__GO__ but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ it ' s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__		i ' . . . __eou__
__GO__ you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__		i , i i . __eou__
__GO__ i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__		you are . __eou__
__GO__ it seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__		what ? __eou__
__GO__ the boss announces the pay raise today , right ? how much do you think we'll get ? __eou__		i , i . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ no idea . your guess is as good as mine . __eou__		i you . __eou__
__GO__ it better be more than last year . __eou__		i , you __eou__
__GO__ i'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ what a pity ! __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ if you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? __eou__		i , . __eou__

__GO__ well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__		that sounds like a good idea
__GO__ that's a good idea . __eou__		i you . __eou__
__GO__ first , let's read clause two about packing . it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__		ok . __eou__
__GO__ agreed . __eou__		i , i . __eou__
__GO__ for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ i want to buy a black suit . __eou__		what size do you __eou__

__GO__ well , i think you ' ve reconsidered our proposal , diane . __eou__		i , i . __eou__
__GO__ yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__		i , . . . . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ that's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ that's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ i see your point . that's to say s 611 each set . still it's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ? __eou__		yes , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that's the best we can do . what do you think of that ? __eou__		i don't think we can . __eou__
__GO__ all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set . __eou__		how much is the __eou__
__GO__ don't i know you ? __eou__		i , i . __eou__

__GO__ no , there's a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . then there's the ceo __UNK__ the chief executive officer . he's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it's too dangerous . that's the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__		so what ? __eou__
__GO__ how many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__		they are . __eou__
__GO__ how much will my pay be , if you don ' t mind my asking ? __eou__		you can be . . __eou__

__GO__ yes , thank you . may i ask for an apartment ? __eou__		of course . __eou__

__GO__ i have not sir . but i do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to chicago every hour from here . __eou__		oh , i see . __eou__

__GO__ i don't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__		i , . . . . . the . __eou__
__GO__ so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.if the problem is resources , share them . __eou__		i , the the the the the the __eou__

__GO__ i know . it really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__		i , you . . . __eou__
__GO__ and it takes up all the news . __eou__		i , i __eou__
__GO__ the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__		i , . __eou__

__GO__ sure you have to be patient . but i think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__		i , . __eou__

__GO__ you know , i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it . __eou__		you , ? ? __eou__
__GO__ the style of the exterior is just what i ' ve been looking for ! __eou__		what ' s the __eou__
__GO__ the exterior is only half of the story . the interior is incredible . __eou__		the is a is of a . __eou__
__GO__ this home is gorgeous on the inside ! __eou__		what you ! __eou__
__GO__ everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . __eou__		that ' s a . __eou__

__GO__ $ 200 . __eou__		how much is it ? __eou__
__GO__ hello , sir . so , you are back ? __eou__		yes , i am . __eou__
__GO__ yes , hello again . i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit . __eou__		ok , . . . . __eou__
__GO__ that's pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate . __eou__		that sounds . __eou__

__GO__ are there any beds vacant ? __eou__		yes , please . __eou__

__GO__ that's easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__		i , i __eou__
__GO__ you're kidding ! something as simple as that ? __eou__		no , ! __eou__
__GO__ yes . it is very important to me . my mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and i know that t __eou__		what you you you ? ? ? __eou__

__GO__ all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up . __eou__		i , . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i was wondering if you could help me with something . __eou__		i , i . . __eou__
__GO__ sure , anything you say . __eou__		i you . __eou__
__GO__ actually , it ' s a little bit silly . __eou__		oh , i ' m __eou__
__GO__ don ' t worry about it , just ask . __eou__		i ' m __eou__
__GO__ what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? __eou__		you can a to a . . . . __eou__
__GO__ you need to know the type of shoes you want . __eou__		i , ? __eou__
__GO__ don ' t worry about that . i can point it out in the store . __eou__		why ? __eou__
__GO__ the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . in girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . __eou__		how much is the ? ? __eou__
__GO__ excuse me . how long has it been since the business was founded ? __eou__		it was it . . __eou__
__GO__ it has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . __eou__		what you you ? ? __eou__
__GO__ so , it has a history for more than a decade ? __eou__		i , i . . __eou__
__GO__ what can i do for you , madam ? __eou__		i want to buy a . . __eou__
__GO__ can you help me with comprehensive credit granting ? __eou__		certainly . __eou__
__GO__ certainly , madam . what would you like to know ? __eou__		i want to buy some of
__GO__ well , everything really . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ let's do something outdoors today . __eou__		ok . __eou__
__GO__ all right . but i don't want to play tennis . we played tennis last weekend . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ okay . what do you want to do ? __eou__		i want to buy some of the
__GO__ i want to go jogging . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ good afternoon . i come here specially to pick up my tickets . i booked it last month.this is my reservation note . __eou__		yes , sir . __eou__
__GO__ i am terribly sorry . you didn't come to reconfirm recently.you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . __eou__		oh , i see . __eou__
__GO__ the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west . __eou__		i , i . i . . __eou__
__GO__ no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__		i , i . . __eou__
__GO__ you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__		that ' s . . __eou__
__GO__ correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__		what you . the ? __eou__
__GO__ any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__		certainly . __eou__
__GO__ yes , plenty of them . don't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__		i you you . __eou__
__GO__ is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__		yes , it . . . __eou__
__GO__ our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__		oh , i see . __eou__
__GO__ we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__		that sounds . __eou__
__GO__ you can double check with the housekeeping department , but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ? __eou__		yes , . . . . . . . . . . . __eou__

__GO__ what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__		i , i the . . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__		what , __eou__
__GO__ that ' s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ' ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__		i ' you t . . __eou__
__GO__ i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ why didn ' t we choose an office in the cbd ? __eou__		i ' m the the the . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__		yes , i have . __eou__
__GO__ yes . we ' ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . we hope to sign another three this month . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ when will the branch office open ? __eou__		the next will be the . __eou__
__GO__ hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__		what are you __eou__
__GO__ has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__		yes . i have a lot of . __eou__
__GO__ yes , it has . we ' re going to target the business community through business magazines . __eou__		i , i . . . __eou__
__GO__ good afternoon . what can i do for you ? __eou__		i want to buy a . . . __eou__
__GO__ i want to pick up my valuables . __eou__		what you have you __eou__
__GO__ may i have your key please ? __eou__		here you are . __eou__
__GO__ sure . here you are . __eou__		thanks . __eou__
__GO__ here is your valuable . is that right ? __eou__		yes . __eou__
__GO__ did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the usa ? __eou__		i , i . in the __eou__
__GO__ why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__		i , i . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__		what ? __eou__
__GO__ do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__		i think so . __eou__
__GO__ no , i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america . __eou__		yes . __eou__
__GO__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__		i think i i the . __eou__
__GO__ i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__		i , . . . . __eou__
__GO__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__		i , . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i know this is going to sound sexist , but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__		i , . . . . __eou__
__GO__ why not ? it's their children , too . __eou__		i , i . . . __eou__
__GO__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__		what you ? __eou__
__GO__ come to think of it , you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments . __eou__		i , i . . __eou__

__GO__ that's right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it's just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__		oh , i see . __eou__

__GO__ well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__		i see . __eou__

__GO__ that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ' s eight time zones east of greenwich ! __eou__		what ! ! ! ! __eou__

__GO__ i met a girl in elevator this morning . she works in a company upstairs . she said she envied the casual way we dress for work . she complained about the dress rule in her company . it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . now , i know the answer . __eou__		you , you you __eou__
__GO__ you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ? __eou__		yes , i . . the . __eou__
__GO__ to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__		i , . . . . __eou__

__GO__ didn't you hear ? he was disqualified . __eou__		yes , i did . __eou__

__GO__ i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__		i , i that i __eou__
__GO__ they are . the only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__		i , ? mean ? __eou__
__GO__ that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__		i , i the . the . . __eou__

__GO__ yes . __eou__		how you you to ? ? __eou__
__GO__ what's the weather like in your country ? __eou__		it's like spring . __eou__

__GO__ have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__		yes . i have been working for a job . __eou__
__GO__ well , no , it can ' t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ? __eou__		yes , i ' . __eou__
__GO__ you couldn ' t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__		i you . __eou__
__GO__ well , that seems easy enough . __eou__		i , you __eou__
__GO__ wait , there ' s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__		i , i that the __eou__
__GO__ geez . is that all ? __eou__		yes . __eou__
__GO__ almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__		i , i that you __eou__
__GO__ i hear that mary got mad . __eou__		what happened ? __eou__
__GO__ so i heard . __eou__		i , you __eou__

__GO__ yeah , if you ' re a girl . __eou__		i , __eou__
__GO__ well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl . __eou__		oh , __eou__
__GO__ that ' s not true . dark angel is a good show . __eou__		what you like __eou__
__GO__ it ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . __eou__		what ' you mean ? __eou__

__GO__ how in the world did you get a copy ? i've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i'm still waiting my turn . __eou__		i , i the . the . __eou__
__GO__ i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day . __eou__		how you you you ? ? __eou__
__GO__ is it really worth paying for ? __eou__		i have no idea . __eou__
__GO__ i can't tell yet . i haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__		i , . . . . __eou__
__GO__ come on , you are left behind ! __eou__		what are you doing ? __eou__
__GO__ wow , i can't catch my breath . you are running too fast , honey . __eou__		i , you , . . .
__GO__ you just need more exercise . __eou__		i , i . __eou__
__GO__ yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing ! __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ i don't care . i want to burn up my fat . __eou__		what happened ? __eou__
__GO__ but running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__		yes , i
__GO__ why ? __eou__		i don't know . i . __eou__
__GO__ we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__		i , i . . . __eou__
__GO__ but i want to burn up more calories ! __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__		i , i . . __eou__
__GO__ hello , daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__		fine , . . . __eou__
__GO__ fine , thank you . i haven ' t seen you for quite some time . what have you been up to recently ? __eou__		i , i , . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . recently , i've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__		what did you __eou__
__GO__ oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they're so scary . __eou__		i , i . . . __eou__
__GO__ yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__		i , i . . __eou__
__GO__ but it's really exciting . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__		i , i
__GO__ yep . __eou__		i you you . __eou__
__GO__ i think you should have a try someday . maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__		i will . __eou__
__GO__ it's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... the trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , i really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__		oh , __eou__
__GO__ the economy has been stagnant for a while now . we've been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__		i see . __eou__
__GO__ are you an art aficionado ? __eou__		i , i i i i . i . __eou__
__GO__ not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , aren ' t you ? __eou__		i , i i i i . i . . i . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__		i think that ' . . . __eou__
__GO__ i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__		i , . . . . . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ art isn ' t for everyone . i ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__		i ' i . i . __eou__
__GO__ i like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i ' d love to go with you . __eou__		i , i i . i . __eou__
__GO__ i thought i ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__		i , i . . . __eou__
__GO__ that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__		we will go to the . . . . __eou__
__GO__ what does your mother do , may i ask ? __eou__		i , m a . . __eou__

__GO__ even if our company didn't have a dress code , i still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__		i , . . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i wouldn't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__		i , . __eou__
__GO__ maybe that's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it's just not respectful to you client . __eou__		i , . . . . __eou__
__GO__ i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__		what you you you to __eou__
__GO__ it's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__		i , i the __eou__

__GO__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__		what about the the __eou__
__GO__ what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ? __eou__		i , we . we ' ll have to go to the office . __eou__
__GO__ quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we'll see st.patrick ' s cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center . it's a landmark in the history of architecture . __eou__		that sounds . __eou__
__GO__ what's there after that ? __eou__		i don't know . __eou__

__GO__ she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . __eou__		oh , . __eou__
__GO__ how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? __eou__		she married her . __eou__
__GO__ three years . they've been dating since freshman year . they're even talking about marriage . __eou__		what you you __eou__
__GO__ really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea . __eou__		i , . . . __eou__
__GO__ what do you mean ? __eou__		i , i the the . __eou__
__GO__ well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . __eou__		i , . __eou__

__GO__ i suppose she's right . does she speak english very slowly ? __eou__		yes , she is . . . __eou__
__GO__ not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__		i , she __eou__
__GO__ it must be interesting to study english . __eou__		i , i . i . __eou__
